Play Without Boundaries is a work in progress. The website was custom-built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, utilising <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt JS</a>, a framework based on <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>. In using the latest technology, <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt JS</a> further creates a blazingly fast static website that is optimised for performance. The interactivity of the website is enhanced through animations â€” one of the latest trend that is prominent in current-day websites. The animations were build with the help of <a href="https://greensock.com/">GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)</a>, the current most robust JavaScript animation library. The media content is hosted and managed by <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a>. This allows for images to be delivered in the correct format and size on every browser.
